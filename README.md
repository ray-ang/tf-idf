# TF-IDtF-T
<em>Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency using Term Collections with Threshold</em><br />
A modified term frequency - inverse document frequency (tf-idf) algorithm using term collections, and normalized term frequency threshold for signal detection

### Features
<ol>
  <li>Text preprocessing</li>
  <li>Collections of terms as topics and subtopics</li>
  <li>Analyze a term, document or message using the term collections</li>
  <li>Sum of TF-IDtF per term collection</li>
  <li>TF threshold for signal detection</li>
  <li>Suitable if with no access to a large document corpus</li>
</ol>

### Applications
<ul>
  <li>Recommender systems</li>
  <li>Simulation, chatbot or robot conversations (rule or retrieval-based, and NLP machine learning)</li>
</ul>
